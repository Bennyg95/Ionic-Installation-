# Ionic-Installation-
A file that installs ionic for me

In order to install ionic you need to:
   * clone this repository
   * run 'sh ionicInstall.sh'

In order to test you should create a new ionic project:

   * ionic start projName
   * cd projName

I test my app with google chrome

If you want to test your's with an android device
feel free to go through the ionic website:
     http://ionicframework.com/getting-started/

     * BEWARE:
       * You will need to install a lot of stuff
